<h2> About </h2>
{% markdown %}

Open States is a collection of tools that make it possible for citizens to
track what is happening in their state's capital by aggregating information
from all fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico and making it available
in a common format.


Open States is a project of the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com).
Thank you to the [Rita Allen Foundation](http://www.ritaallenfoundation.org/)
and [Minnesota Historical Society](http://mnhs.org) for their generous support.

Additionally, collecting this data would not be possible without the support
of a community much larger than the team here at Sunlight.  A special thanks to
all of our volunteer [contributors](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/openstates/graphs/contributors)
and the authors and maintainers of all of the libraries that we depend upon.

Data

Bill, legislator, committee and event data is collected from official sources,

All Open States data is available via this website, [our API](/api/), [bulk downloads](/downloads/) and the [Open States iOS Application](http://itunes.apple.com/app/open-states/id500672932?mt=8).

Code
====

All told, the website and scrapers together comprise approximately 40,000 lines of [Python](http://python.org/),
all of it open source.

The primary projects behind Open States:

* [billy](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/billy/) - powering the backend of Open States from scraping to this very site.
* [openstates](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/openstates/) - source for all of our scrapers and openstates.org templates.
* [validictory](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/validictory/) - helping us keep our data in check.
* [scrapelib](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/scrapelib/) - easy, powerful, error-resistant HTTP library built on [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/).

Third Party Libraries
=====================

We'd like to make special mention of a few projects that have made our life that much easier.
This is far from a comprehensive list of the more than 40 projects that we rely upon throughout the project.

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) -  powering this website and API
* [lxml](http://lxml.de) - the workhorse of our scraping backend
* [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) - for all of our data storage
